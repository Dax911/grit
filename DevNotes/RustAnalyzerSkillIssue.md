# Rust Analyzer Skill Issue

## The Problem

It seems like the `proc-macro` server binary is not present in your Rust toolchain's `bin` directory. This might be causing the issue with proc macro expansion in Rust Analyzer.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

### 1. Update Rust Toolchain

Ensure that your Rust toolchain is up to date. You can update your Rust toolchain using rustup:

```sh
rustup update
```

After updating, check if the `proc-macro` server binary is present in the `bin` directory.

### 2. Install the Nightly Toolchain

If the stable toolchain does not include the `proc-macro` server, you might want to try installing the nightly toolchain, as it often includes more features and tools:

```sh
rustup install nightly
```

After installing, switch to the nightly toolchain for your project:

```sh
rustup override set nightly
```

Then check again if the `proc-macro` server binary is present in the `bin` directory of the nightly toolchain.

### 3. Check Rust Analyzer Configuration

Ensure that Rust Analyzer is configured to use the correct toolchain. You can specify the toolchain in your VSCode settings (`.vscode/settings.json` in your project directory or in the global VSCode settings):

```json
"rust-analyzer.rustc.source": "discover",
"rust-analyzer.linkedProjects": [
  "path/to/your/Cargo.toml"
]
```

### 4. Restart VSCode

After making these changes, restart VSCode to ensure that all changes take effect and Rust Analyzer reloads with the correct configuration.

If the issue still persists after trying these steps, you might want to seek help on the [Rust Analyzer GitHub repository](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer) or the [Rust users forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/).
