# Configuration Files Specification for GRIT

## Overview

Implement a robust and flexible configuration system within GRIT to allow users and administrators to customize and control the behavior of the GRIT tool.

## Features

### 1. **File Format Support**

- **TOML**: Primary configuration file format due to its readability and simplicity.
- **JSON**: Optional support for users who prefer JSON.

### 2. **Configuration File Hierarchy**

- **System-Wide Configuration**: Located in a system-specific directory (e.g., `/etc/grit/config.toml` on Linux). Applies defaults for all users.
- **User-Specific Configuration**: Located in the user’s home directory (e.g., `~/.gritconfig.toml`). Overrides system-wide settings for the specific user.
- **Project-Specific Configuration**: Located in the project’s root directory (e.g., `.grit/config.toml`). Overrides user-specific and system-wide settings for the specific project.
- **Ignore Config**: Will need an ignore file at somepoint.

### 3. **Configuration Options**

- **Repository Settings**: Configure repository-specific settings such as default branch name, commit message template, etc.
- **User Information**: Set global user information such as name and email.
- **Network Settings**: Configure network-related settings such as proxy, timeouts, etc.
- **UI/UX Customizations**: Customize the command-line interface appearance, colors, and output format.
- **Hooks**: Define scripts or commands to be run at specific points in the GRIT workflow (e.g., pre-commit hook).
- **Extensions**: Configure and manage extensions or plugins.

### 4. **Environment Variable Overrides**

- Allow configuration settings to be overridden by environment variables for scripting and automation purposes.

### 5. **Configuration Validation**

- Validate configuration files for syntax errors and invalid options.
- Provide helpful error messages and suggestions for fixing configuration issues.

### 6. **Configuration File Management Commands**

- Implement GRIT commands to view, edit, and validate configuration files.

## Implementation Details

### File Parsing and Serialization

- Use the `toml` and `serde_json` crates for parsing TOML and JSON configuration files.
- Implement a configuration struct that derives `serde::Deserialize` to easily load configuration settings.

### Configuration Loading and Merging

- Implement a function to load configuration files in the correct order (system-wide, user-specific, project-specific) and merge the settings.
- Ensure that environment variable overrides are applied after loading and merging configuration files.

### Validation and Error Handling

- Implement validation functions to check for common configuration errors.
- Provide clear and actionable error messages for configuration issues.

### Configuration Management Commands

- Implement GRIT commands such as `config get`, `config set`, `config edit`, and `config validate` to manage configuration settings.

## Future Enhancements

- **Interactive Configuration Setup**: Implement an interactive setup wizard for initializing and updating configuration settings.
- **Configuration Profiles**: Support for saving and switching between different configuration profiles.
- **Encrypted Configuration**: Option to encrypt sensitive configuration settings.
- **Remote Configuration**: Support for fetching configuration settings from a remote server.

This specification outlines the structure, features, and implementation details for the configuration system in GRIT, providing a flexible and user-friendly way to customize and control the tool’s behavior.
