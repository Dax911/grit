# GRIT

Work in progress

## Welcome to GRIT: Git Reimagined in Rust Interface Tool

I am building this GIT alternative in Rust as a practice exercise in learning Rust and backend things

Eventually I hope to make it more feature rich and perhaps something akin to an open source version of the tools and features we know and love in Github.

## To Do

 - [ ] Version Control 
 - [ ] Built in Commit conventions
 - [ ] A templating system for commits
 - [ ] Server stuff
 - [ ] Git Interoperatability
 - [ ] Pull Requests
